# ADR 001: Service Decomposition

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As we design the Dokkerr platform, we need to determine an appropriate service architecture that will allow for
scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy while not introducing unnecessary complexity.

## Decision Drivers

* Business domain complexity
* Need for independent scaling of different components
* Team structure and development velocity
* Long-term maintainability
* Performance requirements for real-time booking operations

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Monolithic Architecture

* Single codebase with modular components
* Shared database
* Simpler deployment and testing
* Potential bottlenecks for scaling specific functions

### Option 2: Microservices Architecture

* Separate services for distinct business domains
* Independent deployment and scaling
* Database per service
* Higher complexity in testing and deployment

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

* Core booking engine as a monolith
* Supporting services (payment, notifications, etc.) as microservices
* Mixed database approach

## Decision

We will implement **Option 2: Microservices Architecture** with the following service boundaries:

1. **User Service** - User accounts, profiles, preferences
2. **Dock Service** - Dock listings, amenities, availability management
3. **Booking Service** - Reservation processing and management
4. **Payment Service** - Payment processing and financial transactions
5. **Notification Service** - Email, SMS, and push notifications
6. **Review Service** - Ratings and reviews for docks and renters
7. **Search Service** - Dock discovery and search functionality
8. **Admin Service** - Administrative operations and reporting

## Consequences

### Positive

* Services can scale independently based on demand (e.g., search service during peak seasons)
* Teams can develop, test, and deploy independently
* Technology stack can be optimized for each service's needs
* Failures are isolated to specific services
* Easier to implement different SLAs for different functions

### Negative

* Increased operational complexity
* Need for service discovery and API gateway
* Distributed transactions require careful design
* More complex testing for end-to-end scenarios
* Potential performance overhead from service communication

## Implementation Notes

* Services will communicate primarily via RESTful APIs
* Event-driven patterns will be used for asynchronous operations
* Initial service boundaries may evolve as we learn more about usage patterns
* Each service will manage its own database to maintain independence
* API gateway will handle routing, authentication, and rate limiting
