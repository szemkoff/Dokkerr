# Operations Overview

## Introduction

This section provides comprehensive documentation on operating and maintaining the Dokkerr platform. It covers essential operational aspects including deployment, monitoring, maintenance, scaling, and incident response procedures.

Operations are a critical component of the Dokkerr platform, ensuring the service remains available, performant, and secure for all users. This documentation serves as a guide for operations teams, system administrators, and DevOps engineers responsible for the platform's day-to-day management.
