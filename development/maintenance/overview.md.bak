# Maintenance Overview

## Introduction

The Dokkerr platform includes a comprehensive maintenance system that handles database management, monitoring, backups, and system health checks. This section provides detailed information about the maintenance features and how to use them effectively.

## Key Features

### Maintenance Mode
- Controlled system access during maintenance
- Automatic connection management
- Safe state preservation
- Backup creation before maintenance

### Database Management
- Automated backups with compression
- Safe restore procedures
- Database cleanup and optimization
- Index management
- Table vacuuming

### Monitoring
- Real-time system metrics
- Connection tracking
- Query performance monitoring
- Resource usage alerts
- Custom threshold configuration

### Scheduled Tasks
- Default maintenance schedules
- Custom schedule support
- Task status tracking
- Failure handling and notifications

## API Endpoints

### Maintenance Mode
```typescript
POST /api/maintenance/start    // Start maintenance mode
POST /api/maintenance/end      // End maintenance mode
GET  /api/maintenance/status   // Get maintenance status
```

### Database Management
```typescript
POST /api/maintenance/cleanup  // Run database cleanup
POST /api/maintenance/backup   // Create backup
POST /api/maintenance/restore  // Restore from backup
```

### Monitoring
```typescript
POST /api/maintenance/monitor/start  // Start monitoring
POST /api/maintenance/monitor/stop   // Stop monitoring
GET  /api/maintenance/health         // Get system health
```

### Scheduling
```typescript
POST /api/maintenance/schedule       // Schedule maintenance
GET  /api/maintenance/schedule       // Get maintenance schedule
```

## Default Schedule

The system comes with pre-configured maintenance schedules:

```typescript
// Daily backup at 2 AM
schedule: '0 2 * * *'

// Weekly cleanup on Sunday at 3 AM
schedule: '0 3 * * 0'

// Monthly vacuum on 1st at 4 AM
schedule: '0 4 1 * *'
```

## Configuration

Maintenance settings can be configured through environment variables:

```env
# Database Management Configuration
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=7
MAX_BACKUP_SIZE_MB=1000
BACKUP_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=9
DB_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MS=5000
SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD_MS=1000
HIGH_CPU_THRESHOLD=80
HIGH_MEMORY_THRESHOLD=80
DEAD_TUPLE_THRESHOLD=10000
UNUSED_INDEX_SIZE_MB=10
OLD_TRANSACTION_DAYS=7
TEMP_FILE_DAYS=1
```

## Security

The maintenance system includes several security features:
- Admin-only access to maintenance endpoints
- Automatic backup creation before operations
- Connection management during maintenance
- Audit logging of maintenance activities

## Best Practices

1. **Scheduling Maintenance**
   - Schedule maintenance during low-traffic periods
   - Set appropriate intervals for different tasks
   - Monitor task execution times
   - Configure alerts for failed tasks

2. **Backup Management**
   - Maintain multiple backup copies
   - Verify backup integrity regularly
   - Test restore procedures periodically
   - Configure appropriate retention periods

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor system metrics regularly
   - Address performance issues proactively
   - Optimize database queries and indexes
   - Clean up unused resources

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set appropriate alert thresholds
   - Monitor resource usage trends
   - Track long-running queries
   - Monitor connection counts

## Pipeline Integration

The maintenance system is integrated with the CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
maintenance:
  stage: maintenance
  script:
    - npm run db:backup
    - npm run db:cleanup
    - npm run db:vacuum
    - npm run db:reindex
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"
      when: always
    - when: manual
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - backups/
    expire_in: 1 week
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Maintenance Mode Stuck**
   ```typescript
   // Force disable maintenance mode
   await maintenanceService.disableMaintenanceMode();
   ```

2. **Failed Backups**
   - Check disk space
   - Verify database permissions
   - Check backup directory permissions

3. **High Resource Usage**
   - Monitor system metrics
   - Check for long-running queries
   - Review connection counts
   - Analyze query plans

4. **Task Scheduling Issues**
   - Verify cron expressions
   - Check task dependencies
   - Monitor task execution times
   - Review error logs
