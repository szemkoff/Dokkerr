# Scalability

This page details the scalability considerations and implementation in the Dokkerr application.

## Scalability Approach

Dokkerr is designed with scalability as a core architectural principle to handle growing numbers of users, listings, and transactions. Our approach focuses on:

- **Horizontal Scalability**: Adding more instances rather than upgrading existing ones
- **Vertical Scalability**: Strategic resource increases for specific components
- **Data Partitioning**: Sharding and intelligent data distribution
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching to reduce database load

## Load Balancing



Our load balancing strategy includes:

- **Layer 7 Load Balancing**: For HTTP-aware traffic distribution
- **Health Checks**: Automatic removal of unhealthy instances
- **Session Affinity**: When needed for specific use cases
- **Geographic Distribution**: Using AWS Global Accelerator for reduced latency

## Database Scaling

Dokkerr employs several techniques to scale database operations:

### Read Replicas

For read-heavy operations like searching for dock listings:

- Multiple read replicas distribute query load
- Primary database handles writes only
- Replicas are added based on read-to-write ratio monitoring

### Sharding Strategy

For handling large data volumes:

- Geographic sharding for dock listings (by region/location)
- User data sharded by user ID ranges
- Booking history sharded by time periods

### NoSQL for Specific Workloads

- MongoDB for dock listing catalog (flexible schema, geospatial queries)
- Redis for session management and caching
- Elasticsearch for full-text search capabilities

## Autoscaling Policies

Dokkerr's infrastructure automatically scales based on::

| Metric | Scale Out Threshold | Scale In Threshold | Cooldown Period |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| CPU Utilization | >70% for 3 minutes | <30% for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Request Count | >1000 req/sec for 2 minutes | <500 req/sec for 15 minutes | 3 minutes |
| Database Connections | >80% of max connections | <40% of max connections | 10 minutes |

## Caching Strategy

### Multi-level Caching



### Cache Invalidation

We implement different invalidation strategies based on data type:

- **TTL (Time-To-Live)**: For dock availability and pricing
- **Write-Through**: For user profiles and preferences
- **Event-Based Invalidation**: For booking status changes

## Microservices Scaling

Each microservice scales independently based on its specific workload:

| Service | Primary Scaling Metric | Notes |
|---------|------------------------|-------|
| Booking Service | Transactions per second | Scales up during peak seasonal demand |
| Search Service | Queries per second | Elastic scaling based on user activity |
| Payment Service | Payment processing queue depth | Critical service with priority scaling |
| Notification Service | Message queue length | Batch processing allows for efficient scaling |

## Performance Testing and Monitoring

Our continuous performance testing regimen includes:

- Load testing to 10x expected peak traffic
- Stress testing to identify breaking points
- Endurance testing to find memory leaks
- Real-user monitoring for actual performance data

Metrics are tracked in Grafana dashboards with alerts configured for early warning of scalability issues.
