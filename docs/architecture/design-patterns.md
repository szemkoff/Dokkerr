# Design Patterns

This page outlines the key design patterns used in the Dokkerr application architecture.

## Architectural Patterns

### Microservices

Dokkerr employs a microservices architecture to enable:

- Independent scaling of services based on demand
- Language and technology flexibility for different services
- Resilience through service isolation
- Faster development cycles through smaller, focused teams



### Event-Driven Architecture

For asynchronous operations, we implement an event-driven approach:

- Services emit events when state changes occur
- Interested services subscribe to relevant events
- Reduces coupling between services
- Enables eventual consistency



## Design Patterns by Category

### Creational Patterns

| Pattern | Usage in Dokkerr |
|---------|------------------|
| Factory Method | Creating different payment processor instances based on configuration |
| Builder | Complex booking object construction with optional parameters |
| Singleton | Configuration and logging services |
| Dependency Injection | Used throughout the application for testability and flexibility |

### Structural Patterns

| Pattern | Usage in Dokkerr |
|---------|------------------|
| Adapter | Integration with third-party payment gateways |
| Decorator | Adding features to notification services (SMS, Email, Push) |
| Facade | Simplifying complex booking processes |
| Proxy | Caching for frequently accessed dock listings |

### Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | Usage in Dokkerr |
|---------|------------------|
| Observer | Notifying interested parties about booking status changes |
| Strategy | Different pricing strategies for seasonal and special events |
| Chain of Responsibility | Processing booking requests through validation, availability, and pricing checks |
| State | Managing booking lifecycle (requested, confirmed, active, completed, cancelled) |

## Mobile App Patterns

On the mobile front-end, we implement:

- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: For separation of concerns
- **Provider Pattern**: For state management
