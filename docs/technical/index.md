# Dokkerr System Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Dokkerr system architecture, explaining the design decisions, component interactions, and technology choices that shape our platform.

## Architectural Overview

Dokkerr follows a microservices architecture with a clear separation of concerns. This approach enables our team to develop, deploy, and scale individual components independently.

## Key Architecture Principles

Dokkerr's architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a distinct responsibility and domain.
2. **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on load requirements.
3. **Resiliency**: The system is designed to handle failures gracefully.
4. **Security**: Multiple layers of security controls protect user data and system integrity.
5. **Maintainability**: Code is organized to facilitate maintenance and extension.
6. **Performance**: The architecture optimizes for response time and resource efficiency.

## System Component Details

### Client Layer

The client layer consists of applications that users interact with directly:

- **Mobile Application**: Native iOS and Android applications built with React Native
- **Web Application**: React-based web application providing the same functionality as the mobile app
- **Admin Dashboard**: Internal tool for system administrators and support staff

### API Gateway Layer

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests:

- **Authentication**: Validates user identity and issues JWT tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects services from excessive requests
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across service instances
- **Request Routing**: Directs requests to appropriate services

### Service Layer

The service layer contains the core business logic of the application:

- **User Service**: Manages user accounts, profiles, and authentication
- **Listing Service**: Handles dock listings, availability, and search
- **Booking Service**: Processes booking requests and manages reservations
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing and financial transactions
- **Messaging Service**: Manages conversations between users
- **Review Service**: Handles ratings and reviews for listings and users
- **Search Service**: Provides optimized search functionality with geospatial capabilities
- **Notification Service**: Manages email, SMS, and push notifications

### Data Layer

The data layer stores and manages application data:

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for structured data
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching and real-time functionality
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible storage for images and documents

## Communication Patterns

Services communicate using a combination of synchronous and asynchronous patterns:

### Synchronous Communication

- **REST APIs**: Standard HTTP-based communication between services
- **GraphQL**: Used for complex data queries from client applications

### Asynchronous Communication

- **Event Bus**: For propagating events between services
- **Message Queues**: For handling background processing tasks
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication with clients

```mermaid

    participant Service B

    Client->>API Gateway: Request
    API Gateway->>Service A: Forward Request
    Service A->>Service A: Process Request
    Service A->>EventBus: Publish Event
    Service A->>API Gateway: Response
    API Gateway->>Client: Response
    EventBus->>Service B: Consume Event
    Service B->>Service B: Process Event
```

## Scalability Strategy

Dokkerr's architecture is designed to scale horizontally to handle increased load:

- **Stateless Services**: All services are designed to be stateless, allowing for easy horizontal scaling
- **Database Sharding**: For distributing database load across multiple instances
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching to reduce database load
- **Auto-scaling**: Services automatically scale based on predefined metrics

### Scaling Dimensions

- **Geographic Scaling**: Deployment across multiple regions for lower latency
- **Load Scaling**: Increasing capacity to handle more concurrent users
- **Storage Scaling**: Expanding storage capacity for growing data needs

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for all resources
- **API Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, and request signing
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Infrastructure Security**: Network isolation, firewalls, and intrusion detection

## Deployment Architecture

Dokkerr is deployed using containerization and orchestration:

```

### Deployment Process

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline
2. **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing container deployment
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined and versioned as code
4. **Multiple Environments**: Development, staging, and production environments
